For over thirty years, Nick has been buying and selling second-hand books. He learned his trade in the busy markets of the North West, including Stockport, Halifax, and Leeds.</p>\n<p>But Nick isn't just about books. He's also a world-class turntablist and musician. He's played alongside DMC World Champions and is a regular at Todmorden's famous Golden Lion. This mix of books and music is what makes Nick – and The Exchange – unique.</p>\n<p>Nick truly knows his stuff. He's been doing this for decades, from finding rare books to recommending your next favourite album.</p>\n<p>Stop by and have a chat. Browse the carefully picked collection, get advice on your next book or record, or just talk about interesting things, like the anatomy of a wookie.</p>\n<p>And don't forget to ask him about his Exchange Scheme.</p>",
